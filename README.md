# Creative Coding Portfolio

This is a collection of projects from an independent study in interactive visualizations.

This is a still from [this](https://aecollier.github.io/portfolio/live_sketches/) force simulation, where the mouse has a "gravitational" pull or repulsion on the particles, which change color based on their velocity.

Give it a try [here](https://aecollier.github.io/portfolio/live_sketches/)!

You can find other sketches I've done (some working, some not) on [my OpenProcessing page](https://openprocessing.org/user/255658?view=activity).

This is my feature project from learning D3.js, an open-source data viz tool. Interact with it [here](https://observablehq.com/@aecollier/sqrrules), and a number of other interactive visualizations about squirrels in Central Park!
