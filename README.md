This is my feature project from learning D3.js, an open-source data viz tool. Interact with it [here](https://observablehq.com/@aecollier/sqrrules), and a number of other interactive visualizations about squirrels in Central Park!

[Here's](https://github.com/aecollier/portfolio/blob/updates/webcam_lines.tox) the network used to make this, using several pixel shaders.

Here's a more complicated compute shader network, where I've been learning how to make lines between points persist. Technically brute-forcing this a bit, as I'm checking all points with all points and then throwing out connections conditionally, hence the small number of points.

Here's my python code! This project is...

## Extras: p5 sketches

This is a still from [this](https://aecollier.github.io/portfolio/live_sketches/) force simulation, where the mouse has a "gravitational" pull or repulsion on the particles, which change color based on their velocity.

Give it a try [here](https://aecollier.github.io/portfolio/live_sketches/)!

You can find other sketches I've done (some working, some not) on [my OpenProcessing page](https://openprocessing.org/user/255658?view=activity).
