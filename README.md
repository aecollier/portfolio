## TouchDesigner

Persistent lines:
The project below uses pixel and compute shaders, as I've been learning how to make connections between points persist over time. Technically brute-forcing this a bit, as I'm checking all points with all points and then throwing out lines conditionally, hence the small number of points. Find the [project file here](https://github.com/aecollier/portfolio/blob/main/stoch_aesthetic.tox).

The project above was the first iteration of working with lines, using several pixel shaders. [Test it out here!](https://github.com/aecollier/portfolio/blob/updates/webcam_lines.tox)


## Python code - quote generator
I've got a more complex and robust web scraper in production from my work with Old Town Shops which I would be thrilled to tell you more about -- here's a silly scraping exercise to show you what I've been working on in the meantime. This program either generates a random quote from goodreads based on a random positive word, or else takes user input of a recent read to generate a random quote related to it. I would continue developing this by added custom error handling, as selenium is very reliant on pages loading properly and consistently, as well as writing tests and speeding up the scraping.
You can download the files and requirements.txt from the [goodreads folder in my repo](https://github.com/aecollier/portfolio/tree/main/goodreads). 


## D3 Squirrel Census Modeling

As a bonus, this was a feature project from learning D3.js, an open-source data viz tool. I like that it shows my exploration process, even though it's a different language. Interact with it [here](https://observablehq.com/@aecollier/sqrrules), and a number of other interactive visualizations about squirrels in Central Park!
